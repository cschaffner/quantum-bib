## Formatting conventions
* The *citation-key* ("GM84" in the first example below) is the same as in the alpha style, so first letters of up to four authors, together with two digits of the publication year. In case of five or more others, it's the first three authors followed by a '+'. In [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/), this corresponds to the `[authorsAlpha][shortyear]` setting.
* Full names of authors with proper latex spelling including special characters should be provided

See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX#Entry_types) for a list of possible bibtex entries.

@Article{GM84,
Title = {{Probabilistic encryption}},
Author = {Goldwasser, Shafi and Micali, Silvio},
Journal = {Journal of Computer and System Sciences},
Year = {1984},

Month = apr,
Number = {2},
Pages = {270--299},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {A new probabilistic model of data encryption is introduced. For this model, under suitable complexity assumptions, it is proved that extracting any information about the cleartext from the cyphertext is hard on the average for an adversary with polynomially bounded computational resources. The proof holds for any message space with any probability distribution. The first implementation of this model is presented. The security of this implementation is proved under the intractability assumption of deciding Quadratic Residuosity modulo composite numbers whose factorization is unknown.},

@Book{BBD09,
Title = {{Post-Quantum Cryptography}},
Editor = {Bernstein, Daniel J and Buchmann, Johannes and Dahmen, Erik},
Publisher = {Springer},
Year = {2009},
Series = {LNCS},

Abstract = {Digital signatures have become a key technology for making the Internet and other IT-infrastructures secure. Digital signatures provide authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of data. Digital signatures are widely used in identification and authentication protocols. Therefore, the existence of secure digital signature algorithms is crucial for maintaining IT-security. The digital signature algorithms that are used in practice today are RSA [31], DSA [11], and ECDSA [15]. They are not quantum immune since their security relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers and computing discrete logarithms.},
